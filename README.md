# clampwind

A plugin for Tailwind CSS to create fluid variants of any Tailwind CSS utility.


## Installation

Install the plugin from npm:

```sh
npm install -D clampwind
```

Then add the plugin to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    // ...
  },
  plugins: [
    require('clampwind'),
    // ...
  ],
}
```

## Usage

To use this plugin you need to use the `clamp()` function but only with two arguments, the first one is the minimum value and the second one is the maximum value.

### Clamp between smallest and largest breakpoint

Write the tailwind utility you want to make fluid, without any breakpoint modifier, for example:

```html
<div class="text-[clamp(16px,50px)]"></div>
```

This will use Tailwind default largest and smallest breakpoint, or any other breakpoint you have defined, and generate the following css:

```css
.text-\[clamp\(16px\,50px\)\] {
  @media (width >= 40rem) { /* 640px */
    @media (width < 96rem) { /* 1536px */
      font-size: clamp(16px, ... , 50px);
    }
  }
}
```
### Clamp between two breakpoints

Simply add regular Tailwind breakpoint modifiers to the utility, for example:

```html
<div class="md:max-lg:text-[clamp(16px,50px)]"></div>
```

To clamp the CSS property between the two breakpoints you need to use the `max-` modifier, in this case the CSS property will be clamped between the `md` and `lg` breakpoints.

This will generate the following css:

```css
.md\:max-lg\:text-\[clamp\(16px\,50px\)\] {
  @media (width >= 48rem) { /* 768px */
    @media (width < 64rem) { /* 1024px */
      font-size: clamp(16px, ... , 50px);
    }
  }
}
```

### Add custom breakpoints

Tailwind v4 introduced the new configuration via CSS custom properties, but Tailwind will not output in your CSS any custom properties that's not referenced in your CSS, to solve this issue you should use the `@theme static` directive to create custom breakpoints.

```css
@theme static {
  --breakpoint-4xl: 1600px;
}
```

### Clamp between custom values

With Tailwind v4 it's really easy to use one-time custom breakpoints, and this plugin will automatically detect them and use them to clamp the CSS property.

```html
<div class="min-[1000px]:max-xl:text-[clamp(16px,50px)]"></div>
```

This will generate the following css:

```css
.min-\[1000px\]\:max-xl\:text-\[clamp\(16px\,50px\)\] {
  @media (width >= 1000px) { /* 1000px */
    @media (width < 64rem) { /* 1600px */
      font-size: clamp(16px, ... , 50px);
    }
  }
}
```

## TODO

- ~~Merge and order custom breakpoints with Tailwind default ones~~
- ~~Ability to convert px to rem in custom breakpoints~~
- ~~Check for atRules where there is only one media query~~
- ~~Check for atRules where there are no media queries~~
- ~~Create media queries ranges from the smallest to the largest breakpoint for clamp rules with one or zero media queries ranges~~
- ~~I need to also add external ranges for these cases, if there are no breakpoints or only one breakpoint, the plugin should add the external range to the generated CSS. 
Eg. `text-[clamp(16px,50px)]` should generate `@media (width < 40rem) { ... } @media (width >= 96rem) { ... }`~~
- Maybe I should use a similar approach to my fluid variant plugin and make the clamp values with `calc()` and custom properties, it would allow to use calc() and standard CSS for the clamp values. eg. `md:max-lg:text-[clamp(16px, calc(50px *3))]` or `md:max-lg:text-[clamp(--text-sm, --text-lg)]`
- Convert clamped values to rem
- if clamped value has a unit different than px? No conversion? 
- if clamped values has no unit/only numbers transform to `calc(var(--spacing) * value)`
- if clamped value has a token (eg. `xl`), do nothing, not supported yet, maybe in the future I could get the default value from the default theme
- Check if the pxToRem plugin does conversions before the plugin runs
- Check if it works well with vite
- support decreasing values for breakpoints where minValue is greater than maxValue
- support negative values
- Check how it works with mixing breakpoints, eg. `md:max-lg:` and `max-lg:md:` are both valid
- check if it's possible to import utopia-core as a dependency
- support container queries
